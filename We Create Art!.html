				<h2>What is this document?</h2>
				<p>
					This is a close-up horizontal photo taken by “My Life Through A Lens” on Unsplash. It 
					represents an aged brick wall with three windows, all of which are closed. In the 
					center, we can see a black and white graffiti that reads “Together, We Create!”. Above 
					this, there is a pink mouse-like figure in the left bottom corner of the first window, 
					made on pastel yellow corrugated fiber cement. There is also some black splash on it. 
					On the left side of the photograph, there is a vertical dark area and a red paintbrush 
					under the writing, which has white color on its sharp bristles. We can tell that this 
					brush was used to paint the graffiti.</br>
					I think the author wants to praise this slogan that shows support of all creations in 
					street art. The author denounces the whitewashing system and arrests of graffiti 
					artists because they are considered vandals. The author tries to encourage all 
					volunteer street artists to pursue their passion and not give up on their dreams even 
					though they may lose some of their artworks.

				<h2>My photo opinion</h2>
				<p>
					To me, the photograph is interesting and encouraging. In my opinion, since the black 
					part on the left might be the erasure of other graffiti executed by the law, the newly 
					one is placed next to it to criticize the inhumane action. As a result, I agree with 
					author’s opinion and expression.</br>
					In conclusion, I consider this graffiti as a form of support for street artists who 
					are sometimes in danger. It serves as a reminder that graffiti and street art aren’t 
					vandalism but a new art form that reacts to society and acts as a revitalizing tool. 
					In other words, the creative passion of graffiti artists and the desire for 
					self-expression results in unique and inspiring works of art which in turn raise the 
					aesthetic perception of the urban environment.
