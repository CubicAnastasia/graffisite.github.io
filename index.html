				<h2>Short history of graffiti</h2>
				<p>
					The history of graffiti and street art originated in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia" target="_blank">Philadelphia</a> 
					in 1967, when high school students started to spray paint in the city to get the attention of 
					a girl. Over time, graffiti paint spread all over US, usually in inaccessible public places, 
					as a small competition between	artists. Most of them were teenagers, each with	their own 
					original style of artwork. They used these methods to denounce society and its evolution, and 
					used public locations as a place to be seen	and heard.
