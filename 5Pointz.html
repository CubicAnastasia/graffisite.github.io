				<h2>Document presentation and my perspective</h2>
				<h3>Description</h3>
				<p>
					This is a middle shot photograph taken by Nigel Morris. It features the Graffiti Building (aka 5 Pointz) in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queens" target="_blank">Queens</a> 
					at New York City. An abandoned building which contains plenty of diverse graffiti. The atmosphere feels vivid and 
					brightly colored. There is no capital contrast between the painted edifice and the pale cloudy sky.</br>
					As we can see, without colorful graffiti, the building is yellow with a vertical red line on each corner and in each 
					space between gloomy big windows. At the bottom, there are grey and red cars in the little parking area. In the 
					top-right hand corner, there is a scary-looking yellowish rooftop parking.</br>
					In the center, a diagonal graffiti-filled stair leads to the top of the dilapidated establishment from a monochrome 
					portrait of a man. In front of a bright yellow portrait of a woman, there is a small shelter with red graffiti on it. 
					In the top-left hand corner, a big green-texted graffiti is placed on top of the dark purple graffiti. Next to the 
					shadow entrance, a rabid skull with a top hat is presented as a graffiti. Almost all the graffiti in this place is 
					horizontal artworks.
				</p>
				<h3>What do I think about this image?</h3>
				<p>
					I like this image but at the same time, it makes me scared because the edifice’s look doesn’t seem reassuring enough even 
					if graffiti artists added some beautiful artworks. I would rather have an establishment with clean walls that have 
					graffiti on them than a disgusting one. For me beauty and ugliness don’t fit together. I would like to see graffiti on a 
					beautiful building with a perfectly painted facade, which has unique structure, and which can be resemble to architectures 
					from Barcelona instead of a long stick-like made of windows or brick from New York.</br>
					The author, in my opinion, wanted to breathe life into the factory’s facades with graffiti, which could add more 
					fascination to the building, instead of letting it erode under the influence of time and nature.</br>
					If I were an artist, I would first improve walls, windows and doors then paint on them. It would be more unique and 
					interesting if I created some relief or added different materials as sculptures to complement my graffiti. It could be a 
					new style of street art, making extravagant and offering more opportunities to create own artworks, since most people of 
					the new generation believe that street art is as permanent as “fine art”.

				<h2>The photographer’s message</h2>
				<h3>What is the objective of the photographer?</h3>
				<p>
					The context of the photograph is the visible presentation of the graffiti paints in the abandoned district. The author 
					praises the successful artworks realized by different graffiti artists in various and original ways. The photographer 
					wants to show us the beauty of the new artistic style, one of the street arts, which compensates the ugliness of the 
					building. His goal is to reveal the possibility of beauty in the unprivileged communities with art, and that the graffiti 
					serves as a revitalizing tool instead of offense.
				</p>
				<h3>Do I agree with the photographer’s perspective?</h3>
				<p>
					I agree with the choices he made because I think as he does ; he supports the conservation of this historic building 
					containing some of the bests graffiti artists in the world. As a result, I won’t perceive the photograph any 
					differently.</br>
					In my opinion, the building itself isn’t beautiful. But since it’s already filled with the most stunning artworks, it 
					already becomes a great museum to visit. I don’t think it’s useful to change the establishment to either make the museum 
					cleaner or to remove graffiti.

				<h2>NYC judge awards $6.7m to graffiti artists</h2>
				<p>
					After the <a href="https://theconversation.com/how-21-artists-graffitied-one-mans-property-made-it-famous-sued-him-when-he-knocked-it-down-and-won-6-7m-91933" target="_blank">Wolkoff's process</a>, 
					this will serve as a motivation for other graffiti artists to sue property owners who has behaved badly over artists’ 
					efforts and rights, disregarding the notice required by VERA. After judge Frederic Block publicly deterred future acts 
					similar to Wolkoff’s, other owners of construction filled with legal graffiti begin to hesitate to demolish, so they 
					wouldn’t face the consequent penalty. Since graffiti and street art have changed the durability of their creations, the 
					artistic movement aims to make its art more permanent, just like traditional art. Until then, society considered graffiti 
					and street art as temporary art form. That’s how the gap between street art and fine art is narrowing, and maybe future 
					generation will perceive these arts as one and the same.
