				<h2>One of the graffiti pieces in Ukraine</h2>
				<p>
					I choose the photograph of Banksy’s graffiti in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borodianka" target="_blank">Borodyanka</a>, 
					Ukraine, taken during the Russian invasion. The painting is sprayed on a destroyed 
					building, in an area heavily impacted by Russian bombing raids. Cracks are visible, 
					along with a brick foundation that is normally hidden, and another demolished 
					building in the background. The sky in the top right corner appears gloomy and 
					smoky. In the center, there are a boy and an adult wearing judo clothing. The one 
					who has beaten is wearing a black ribbon on his torso, symbolizing a dangerous enemy. 
					His face and hair resemble Vladimir Putin. This close-up picture focuses on the 
					central figures, thereby making it difficult to see the surroundings, but effectively 
					capturing the current situation.</br>
					The other judoka is a young but extraordinarily strong individual because he can 
					deliver a knockout punch to his opponent. This can be interpreted as the young boy 
					representing a small country being invaded by the menacing grown-man judoka depicting 
					Russia. The strong child looks serious and furious since his eyes and forehead are dark. 
					The unsuccessful judoka lies in a defeated pose, labeling him as a talentless warrior 
					and diplomat. In the end, it appears that the child is winning over the unfairly 
					dreadful tall adult.</br>
					I choose this photograph because I want to explain what Banksy’s graffiti wants to tell 
					us and who the two characters are. I find this painting extremely intriguing and 
					indisputable; there is no reason to talk otherwise about Russia’s terrible act, which 
					goes against human right. Banksy encourages Ukraine for its right to exist and praises 
					its tough defense against powerful war criminal, making his graffiti very popular. This 
					spray paint isn’t the only in the Ukraine; Banksy has also painted many other artworks 
					supporting Ukraine. I believe that his position also supports the Russian people who 
					don’t agree with Putin’s decision to go to war against his neighbor.</br>
					Personally, this is the very emotional symbol of resistance against authoritarian, greedy 
					Russia, which constantly want to steal territories without any exchange and compromise.
