				<h2>What are its goals?</h2>
				<p>
					First, <a href="https://puntourbanartmuseum.org/open-air-museum/art/" target="_blank">Salem Punto Urban Art Museum</a>’s 
					mission is to increase economic opportunities for local businesses and break down 
					socio-economic barriers. It also instills neighborhood pride when street artists share 
					their stories through their murals and provide access to art in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salem,_Massachusetts" target="_blank">Salem</a> 
					for both residents and visitors.

				<h2>Chromed Dog</h2>
				<p>
					There are three parts of the document. The first one is on the left side of the 
					picture; we can see a light black streetlamp and brown buildings in the background. The 
					second part is a mural in the middle of the photograph, which represents a chrome dog on 
					a white environment. The third shows a three story-building on the right side. The photo 
					is a middle-shot since we can’t really see the entire residential building and its 
					surroundings. The lines on the mural are based on the letter “x”, starting from the dog’s 
					left ear to its right paw and from its right ear to its left hind leg.</br>
					There are two elements that differ in this image: one featuring a beautiful artwork of a 
					realistic cute dog, and the other depicting a plain building. It appears to be a low-income 
					area since the balconies are small, and the overall look isn’t appealing.</br>
					We can only see the dog patiently waiting for something or someone. The dog is facing the 
					viewer, sitting on its hind legs. It looks calm, with its attention seemingly focused on 
					something surprising. It’s not an ordinary dog, it’s a chromed dog, as its relief and 
					reflection are as realistic as if it was made of chrome, creating a stark contrast between 
					the black and white parts of its body.</br>
					The photograph is a mid-shot image in three parts, featuring the mural “Chromed Dog”, painted 
					by Bik Ismo in Salem, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts" target="_blank">Massachusetts</a>, 
					in October 2017. Next to the artwork, there is a streetlamp facing the same direction as the 
					chromed dog. On the right side, there’s a low-income residential building with small 
					balconies, each made of different materials. In this mural, there’s a serious-looking grey 
					chromed bulldog. Unlike the Mona Lisa painting, the dog doesn’t seem to be looking at us; its 
					attention is focused outside of our view. There’s an ordinary streetlamp in front of it, at 
					the level of its torso.</br>
					We can conclude that the mural was painted on the residential building to enhance its 
					attractiveness. It arouses a sense of pride in the residents, allowing them to live with 
					unique street art. Salem is one of the cities that contains the most diverse murals, 
					attracting tourists and visitors. This spray paint masterpiece should be included in the Salem 
					Punto Urban Art Museum, which is progressively gaining popularity among tourists and visitors.

				<h2>What does the author want to say?</h2>
				<p>
					The author passes on a message to viewers that the mural was created with affection and volunteerism 
					to bring happiness and pride to the neighborhood, transforming it into a colorful habitat where 
					residents can feel joy instead of sadness while living in an underprivileged district.</br>
					The author surprises some observers by revealing that murals in Salem are more innocent and positive, 
					rather than being considered offensive or vandalistic. These friendly and inspiring works are crafted 
					by many talented street artists from all over the world who want to proudly express themselves in 
					Salem, a city marked by witch trials in the 1690s and enduring discrimination. The author amuses those 
					who believe that street art is always aggressive by showcasing “Chromed Dog”, a piece that perfectly 
					captures an empathetic, realistic chrome dog. This surprises them and makes them appreciate it, even 
					though it is a form of graffiti art.

				<h2>What do I think about “Chromed Dog”?</h2>
				<p>
					This document is very interesting and cunning, especially for someone who used to believe that street 
					art is always threatening. I like this demonstration; it is entertaining and efficient in explaining 
					many things. I find it impressive to consider murals and graffiti as genuine art forms, given that 
					they are created with great skill and effort, aiming to be as fascinating as possible. Personally, 
					with time, street art has become the most efficient way to publicly share one’s expression and opinion 
					in the realm of art. And I also appreciate that graffiti art goes beyond mere writing on the wall but 
					evolves to include larger and more colorful works that become murals. In conclusion, I agree with the 
					author.</br>
					I like this mural because the chrome dog is realistic and fascinating; the contrast between white 
					and black is very clever. The bulldog has an interesting expression, because we can see that it waits 
					quietly for something or someone. What's even more amusing is that the dog and the streetlamp seem 
					to be facing in the same direction. The spotlight makes the grey dog appear more brilliant and 
					courageous. I find the artist's decision to depict the reflection of the blue sky on the dog's body 
					to emphasize the chrome effect very entertaining, making the work fantastic. The artist of “Chromed 
					Dog” must be great in painting in the classical art style. Personally, I find the curious dog very 
					cute and funny.
