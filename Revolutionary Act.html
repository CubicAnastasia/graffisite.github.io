				<h2>Consequences of graffiti activity</h2>
				<p>
					In the late 1960s, graffiti appeared in Philadelphia. The artists would use inaccessible public 
					places to paint graffiti. However, it quickly became a transgressional movement, that’s why it 
					was considered as vandalism, so some cities decided to fight it.</br>
					Galleries started buying some artworks, that’s why it spread out and took different forms. A lot 
					of street art artists are now successful because plenty of people compete to collect their 
					artworks. They have also become drivers who help poor communities.

			<h2>The graffiti as a revitalizing tool</h2>
			<p>
				Modern artists, especially graffiti and street art artists, influence economic and social changes in 
				impoverished neighborhoods because their artworks are used to revitalize these areas, attracting 
				tourists.</br>
				There has also been a change in the main competition among artists, especially since the introduction 
				of graffiti, because of the popularity of the street art in the United States at the end of 20th 
				century.</br>
				The graffiti was created by teenagers. As a result, the society’s perception toward the artists has 
				changed, making the new style of art possible for all ages, not only for professional adults.</br>
				The graffiti paint gained so much acclaim and admiration, that some art galleries started buying it.
